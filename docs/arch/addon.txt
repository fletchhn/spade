Addons are a method for third-party developers to package and distribute their
work to others.  The addon system can be used to distribute everything from
a single type implementation to a full system for viewing and editing a file
format comprised of templates, types, scripts, and specialized editing tools.
Addons should be loaded from ~/.spade/ directory and must be loaded in order
defined by their name presedence (that means that one has to sort files and
directories found in the directory and load them in that order).
