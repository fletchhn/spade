This document describes the way changes aka undo subsystem works.  The two main
classes that are responsible for working with all of this are File and FileView
which reside in core.file .  The ``changes'' table in the database stores the
actual changes that will be made and ``head'' column in ``files'' table points
to the head change the file itself is in.  When a new file is added to the
project and opened, its HEAD is set to 0.  Each change to the file is a simple
action (insert or erase) of some bytes of some length at some position in some
file.  All changes are stored in ``changes'' table for the lifetime of the file
in project database.  Hash of a change is SHA256 hash of parent change's hash,
type of change (as '+' or '-' character) and bytes that are being changed.  Each
change can optionally have a comment, note or annotation associated with (stored
in ``com'' column).  Changes can be applied to the file itself or a new file can
be created based on the original file at a specific change selected by user.
When the change is applied to file itself, its ``hash'' in ``files'' should be
updated and ``head'' set to the change being applied.
